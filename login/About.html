                <h2>Price Action</h2>
                <h3> RSI - Relative Strength Index</h3><br>
                <b>The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a powerful tool that analyzes the speed and strength of price movements. The RSI ranges from 0-100.
                A lower RSI usually less than 30 indicates that an asset is in the oversold region so it helps users in taking up long term positions while a high RSI usually > 90 indicates an overbought momentum thus triggering a sell.</b> <br>
                <h3> MACD - Moving Average Convergence and Divergence</h3><br>
                <b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. Traders use the MACD to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high to identify entry and exit points for trades.</b>
